//! The editing session: a project, its id mint, and undo.
//!
//! Undo is whole-state snapshots. The document is small - a heavy project is
//! a few hundred kilobytes - so cloning per edit is cheaper than maintaining
//! inverse operations and impossible to get wrong. The depth cap bounds the
//! memory; two hundred undos of a large project is tens of megabytes, which
//! an editor holding gigabytes of frame data does not notice.
