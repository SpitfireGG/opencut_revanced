# The notes for a release or a nightly, from the commits it is made of.
#
# Usage: release-notes.sh <since-ref> <until-ref> <title> [nightly]
#
# Writes markdown to stdout: what changed, as the subjects of the commits
# between the two refs; how to install each bundle; the checksum file; the
# licences. The commits are the changelog - each subject on main is written
# as a sentence a user can read - so there is no second file to keep in
# step with them.
#
# What a release note is for is what somebody running the app can notice, so
# three kinds of subject are dropped on the way past. Housekeeping, by its
# shape: formatting, lock files, "Update foo.rs". Anything typed as work on
# the tree rather than on the product - a conventional-commit `test:`,
# `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `refactor:`, `style:` or `docs:` says so
# itself. And a fix that only got the build green again: a lint appeased, an
# import removed, a file moved to please a compiler is not a fix anybody
# asked for.
#
# A subject that survives is printed as a sentence. A `feat(studio):` in
# front of one is scaffolding for the log and reads as noise in a release,
# so the type comes off and the first letter goes up. A subject that appears
# twice appears once.
